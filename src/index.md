Welcome to my blog.

## About me

I am a C++ programmer, currently working at Chaos as a developer on the Envision project. Alongside my professional work, I actively maintain several open-source projects, including the BL programming language suite and the Tine code editor. In my free time, I am developing a 3D first-person game with a custom rendering engine written from scratch in BL, leveraging the modern Vulkan API with support for ray tracing and advanced global illumination techniques.
